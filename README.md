# InSeason

A visual calendar of in season fruits and vegetables, made with less than 5k of dart code.

This project was made for the #FlutterCreate contest, organised by the Flutter team at Google. 

The data in the app was randomly generated and filled with 'Lorem Ipsum' for texts. A later version will be published with actual data.
